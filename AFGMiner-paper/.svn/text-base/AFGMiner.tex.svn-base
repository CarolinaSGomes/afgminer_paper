\begin{abstract}
Flow graphs are an abstraction used to represent elements (\eg digital data, goods, electric current) that travel through a network of nodes (\eg computers, physical locations, circuit parts) and are typically applied to model logistics problems. The paths between nodes are represented as directed edges in the flow graph. The amount of elements that go through the paths between nodes, or the frequency of transmission of such elements between nodes, are represented as edge weights. If additional data is associated with the nodes, we have attributed flow graphs. We define heavyweight patterns as those sub-sets of attributes, found in a dataset of attributed flow graphs, that are connected by edges and have a computed weight higher than an user-defined threshold. We present an algorithm called AFGMiner, that is able to find heavyweight patterns in a dataset of attributed flow graphs and associate each pattern with its occurrences. The paper also describes two new tools, HEPMiner and SCPMiner. They use AFGMiner as their mining algorithm and can be used by compiler and application developers, respectively, to solve Profile-based Program Analysis modeled as a heavyweight pattern mining problem.
