This work defined heavyweight patterns and the problem of Heavyweight Pattern Mining. It presented AFGMiner, a heavyweight pattern mining algorithm that is generic enough to be applied to any problem that requires mining of attributed flow graphs, and is able
to find both sub-path and sub-graph patterns. AFGMiner was improved from its original version to use the concepts of location registration. In addition, a parallel version of AFGMiner with location registration was developed that uses a workload distribution heuristic to better balance the mining work performed by different threads.

The tools HEPMiner and SCPMiner, targeted at compiler and application developers, respectively, were created as useful applications of AFGMiner. The heavyweight patterns obtained by such tools were positively evaluated by experts from the IBM Canada Software Laboratory and gave them useful insight into the run-time behavior of analyzed programs.
