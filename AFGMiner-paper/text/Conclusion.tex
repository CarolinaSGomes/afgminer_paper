This work defined heavyweight patterns and the problem of Heavyweight Pattern Mining. It presented AFGMiner, a heavyweight pattern mining algorithm that is generic enough to be applied to any problem that requires mining of attributed flow graphs, and is able
to find sub-path and sub-graph patterns. AFGMiner was improved from its original version to use location registration. In addition, a parallel version of AFGMiner with location registration was developed that uses a workload distribution heuristic to better balance the mining work performed by different threads.

The tool HEPMiner, used for profile-based program analysis, was created as an useful application of AFGMiner. Heavyweight patterns discovered by this tool were positively evaluated by compiler engineers from the IBM Canada Software Laboratory in the context of analyzing flat-profile applications. The tool gave them useful insights on the behavior of such applications, leading to the creation of new performance counters and improvements to instruction scheduling in IBM's Testarossa JIT Compiler.
